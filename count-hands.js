// Copy over your card deck code. You will need that to be working in order
// to complete this exercise.

// 1. Shuffle the deck. This was explained in memory.js.
// 2. Deal a "hand" of seven cards to a player.
// This means there should be a new array called hand that contains 7 cards, and
// those cards should no longer be in the deck.
// Print both of them out to make sure.
// 3. Count how many of each value are in the hand. For example, if the hand ends
// up with Aceclubs, 2hearts, 2diamonds, 4spades, 5hearts, Jdiamonds, Kclubs ...
// Your code should print out something like:
// 1 Ace, 2 2s, 1 4, 1 5, 1 jack and 1 king.

// 4. If you get that working, try doing this with two hands at the same time.
// 5. If you get that working, create a function called hasTwoPair that takes in
// an array called hand and returns a boolean indicating whether or not that hand
// contains exactly two of any value. My example above would return true
// because it has two 2's. But a hand with 7 different cards would return false.
